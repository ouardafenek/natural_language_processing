I'm new to the whole reddit thing, but I saw this and decided it was time to share my experiences. I mean, what's better than telling a bunch of people I don't know in real life shit that is slightly crazy?  So. I have recurring dreams of this old woman. She is the absolute scariest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Every time I dream about her I always wake up in a cold sweat. What's odd is she looks like an old woman, but what scares me the most about her is that she just doesn't act like one. I can't really explain it, but she acts evil. I get this feeling whenever I dream about her that she is just wrong. Innately wrong. Again, I can't really explain it.  I'm always in some dark, dank underground area. Brown, mossy bricks on the wall and it's lit by firelight. If I try to walk off, I end up walking right up on her again, the same place.  Now, what's odd about it is that these dreams happen before something else happens in my life. I've had these dreams four times, each one two weeks out from something happening to a friend or a family member.  **First** one was two weeks prior to my dad falling and breaking his leg on patrol (he's a cop). I was three.  **Second** one was two weeks out of my grandfather dying of cancer. I was eight.  **Third** one was two weeks ahead of my cousin's best friend (who lived with him a mere 10 minutes away from our house) being struck by a drunk driver in a fatal accident. Our family was close with him. I was fourteen.  **Fourth** one was, once again, two weeks prior to my mom falling down a flight of stairs and breaking her back. This is the time I remembered that I had dreamed of her before, though I didn't really notice any pattern until a few months ago. I was seventeen then, and I'm nineteen now. It was a lucid dream at this point, and I remember trying my hardest to wake up (typically with lucid dreams I can 'close my eyes', count to five, and I wake up. I tried that. And no such luck. She told me something terrible was going to happen, and I couldn't stop it. And when I asked her name, she just laughed. Think Mark Hamill as the joker plus an old lady plus nails on a chalkboard, that's what it was like.   She always mentions that something terrible was going to happen and I couldn't stop it.   Now. I know this sort of sounds, no, well, it does sound like a crock of bullshit, but I'm being serious. For some reason, whenever I dream of this creepy lady, something happens to a family member.  So I guess, with this wall of text I'm asking has something like this ever happened to anyone else? Any thoughts as to what the woman might be?  TL;DR version, I dream of an old lady who tells me that terrible things are going to happen two weeks before they do.

I've been around these parts for a long time, just going slightly more undercover for personal reasons.   Anywho. Had a thought the other day: aren't door to door sales pretty much a dying channel in the business world at large? Most companies seem to be moving away from boots on the ground type sales because those dollars are infinitely more valuable spent on online marketing.   So, will the church ever stop sending missionaries out in the field, in exchange for pouring more dollars into their SEO and online marketing campaigns? I know missionary baptism are down-I'm sure the church is at the point where the dollar amount spent per convert baptized by a missionary, the literal  conversion rate  in the mission field, is higher than the yield.   So why not pull all missionaries out of the field and have all those millions of $$ go towards more effective channels?  Because missionary work isn't about baptisms any more. It's about keeping those impressionable youth active and hooked. Plain and simple. The church will pour dough into the missionary program for eternity as long as they can keep those young men and women on the line for lifelong church activity.   Probably an obvious observation.

","content":"  So, with the holidays coming up, I know my family is going all-out for Christmas. I am unable to limit my contact with them right now, since I have a year left on my degree and Im financially dependent on them. I plan to move to a larger city to search for jobs, which would mean further away from my parents.  I know during Christmas, Im given both gifts I want and need. Theyre amazing and my family spends a lot of money on them (ex from the last 2 years: New computer, orthopedic shoes for my bad feet, fancy name brand purses, etc). However, I know its love bombing. Every year after Christmas (by around the new year), my Nparents always talk about how fat I am, how I need to re-evaluate how my life is going because Im fat, non-religious, and liberal. They also act as if my fatness and differing beliefs were done solely as a personal attack on them (ex: Why do you choose to hurt us by being *insert insult*? Do you just like to see us suffer?) They never explicitly mention Christmas or how much they spent on presents, but I noticed this pattern for the past 5-ish years. Before/during Christmas: awesome relationship, tons of holiday cheer, lots of money spent on one another. After Christmas: non-stop conflict with family.  Typically, Ive tried to defend myself over the years. For example, something I may say this year would be: I have a 4.0 this semester. Ive been involved in professional organizations related to my degree. I spend most my days studying. I understand my weight and beliefs upsets you, but please keep in mind Im a good, motivated person. I do not do actions solely to upset you. I support your beliefs, I just happen not to share them. But usually this doesnt work. Typically, this just results in us arguing and screaming more, since obviously Im not a good person if Im fat and dont share their political and religious views.  I know part of it may be that after Christmas comes the new year, and they want to see changes in everyones lives. But still, Im tired of this cycle happening every year. Also, they never mention how much the spend on Christmas, but I feel as if I owe them because they spend so much money on me during the holidays. Anyone got any advice for how to deal with this situation this Christmas?

Fantasy is full of them, but why? I believe that this is caused many writers simply being ignorant of reality/history (which is fine, because it is your story). Independent monarchy must be a kingdom or an empire, it only makes sense, right? It does not, why would it? Map of medieval Europe is full of kingdoms and empires, but it has always had other sovereigning nations such as republics, theocracies other tier level monarchies (marches, duchies, principalities, etc. ). Let's say that your setting has an empire (modelled after the Roman empire), a republic (inspired by Venice) and three kingdoms (inspired by England, France and Spain.), thus you would call that  original and creative setting , but you're not only reinforcing clichs, but also oversimplifying your world. That scenario might work, but would it really hurt to make one of the kingdoms a grand principality instead?   nbsp; I can't be only one who is tired of seeing kingdoms being overused, can I? Making your own unique titles is wonderful, but to avoid overdoing they should be tied to religion or culture, thus instead of a king and emperor you would have a tsar and tenno. nbsp; I also find it odd that most titles in fantasy refer to place instead of people. During medieval era it was common to be ruler of the people, not ruler of the land, before 12th century the no King of England nor King of France, but just King of the English and King of the Franks. Officially there was no King of Sweden before 21st century, but simply King of the Swedes and Belgium's monarch is still styled as King of the Belgians instead of King of Belgium. I've no idea why so many writers tie their ruler titles to land instead of people, perhaps they think it would be too tribalistic to refer them as ruler of people and are simply ignorant of it being a thing.

In case you didn't know, when you max out Bull after the update comes out, he'll reload twice as fast when under 30% health. But for Bull, this isn't that helpful. With his short range combined with his slow move speed and the fact that if you're that low on health as Bull you're probably dead anyways, it doesn't really help him as a high damage dealer or make him desirable to max out. I don't necessarily think that Supercell should change his star ability, but I do have 2 main ideas for him.  1) Buff it| If Supercell does decide to keep Bull's ability as it is, I think they should make his x2 reload speed available earlier. Maybe at around 40%-45% instead of 30%. Just so Bull would maybe be able to get one more clutch kill before he dies, or get 1-2 more shots off on the safe. I think this small change would improve his ability without making it overpowered.  2) Change it up| This is the idea I had in the back of my mind since star abilities were announced. I thought Supercell might actually end up using it. But of course, I was wrong. My idea was plain and simple, Bull no longer takes damage when he charges.  I thought this would change up the way bull is played. Making it so that, it's easier for him to escape when he's low on health, or fix the fact that if he charges a Colt, he almost immediately dies to Colt's super. It would also change how Bull is played offensively. Instead of charging a huddled up team in SnG and being instantly obliterated, the pushback would help him stall the other teams inevitable barrage for a chance to take out a 10 crystal player. It would also make charging past the ball at the start of Brawl Ball (after a goal) a better idea. Instead of being at half health (and most likely going to die) once he reaches the other teams side, he would be at full health and could possibly wipe 2-3 of their players, making him a better pick for Brawl Ball.  It would also make for some pretty clutch plays in Bounty. Say that all the players on the winning team are hiding in a bush. Bull would be able to run into that bush with almost no risk. His pushback would stall for a second and the team wouldn't be able to damage him until he stops charging.  I personally think this upgrade would allow Bull access to plays he would never be able to pull of before and make him a more fun character.  I'll admit it sounds a little overpowered, but there can always be changes. For example, keeping the pushback but doing no damage, or keeping the damage but removing the pushback. I like this idea and although Supercell will never see this, I wanted to share it with you.  Let's get one thing straight about Darryl, I freaking love his character! He looks well balanced, fun and the type of character that Supercell is all about. But that doesn't mean I can't complain about his star ability... Again for those of you who don't know, when Darryl is maxed out, his ability allows him to take 70% less damage when rolling. I won't deny that this is useful, but feel like it wasn't the best choice on Supercell's behalf. Unless you're playing a shotgun character, it's already pretty hard to hit Darryl while he's  rolling. Combining that with the fact that his super has pushback, I find his ability to be almost useless. The only situation I can see this being useful in is if (like bull) he accidentally charges a supering Colt. Other than that, I can't see much use for this ability. But yet again I have 2 ideas to change his star ability. One from my brain and one I stole from someone's comment.  1) EXPLOSIONS!!! Starting with the one I made up, I would replace Darryl's current ability with kind of a reverse Poco's ability. My idea is that when Darryl dies, his barrel explodes and sends planks of wood in all directions. (Like crows super) these planks would do enough damage to finish off a brawler at low health or allow a teammate to take them out quicker, but not enough to turn Darryl into a suicide bomber. I haven't put as much thought into this one so let's talk about the one I read somewhere.  2) MORE EXPLOSIONS!!!!!!! Again, this idea has something to do with Darryl exploding. But this time, the idea is that Darryl pretty much becomes a multi explosion grenade of sorts.  Basically when killed, Darryl pops 4  mini-barrels, one goes up, other goes down, one goes left and the other goes right. Each barrel explodes when it hits the ground, dealing minor damage and spawning 4 even smaller barrels. Again, the barrels all go in different directions and explode, the little barrels doing less damage.  Kind of like those little Russian dolls that all fit into one another. The first explosion's damage would be comparable to both hits from Barleys normal attack. The second being comparable to one hit from the attack.  This idea also isn't as fledged out, but I still think it would be better than his star ability now.  Anyways, those are pretty much my thoughts on Bull and Darryl's abilities. Thanks for reading all this, I really appreciate it.  It took me a really long time to write this, and it would mean a lot if you guys commented and shared your opinion so we could discuss it.

And here:   They also tried to crush it and found that, in one direction, the nanowood was 30 times stronger than commercially used thermal insulation materials such as Styrofoam, aerogel or other foams made of cellulose.   Nanowoods tiny fibers dont cause allergic reactions or irritate lung tissues, unlike glass or wool insulators.   The secret to the nanowood is the removal of lignin, the part that makes it brown and rigid. The team also removed some of the short fibers that tangle themselves in with the cellulose fibers that make up the scaffolding-like base structure of the wood. The aligned cellulose fibers then bond with each other and results in a high mechanical strength.   For those interested, here is a link to a popular press article on the same study:  https://www.inverse.com/article/42101-energy-saving-nanowood-will-build-homes  From this article, I got the reference to the colour of the material changing here:   When you remove this yellowish-component [lignin], the wood is still a piece of wood but it becomes completely white, Liangbing Hu, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, tells Inverse. It also becomes much lighter because were removing material from the wood and it becomes an excellent insulator. So you can use it for the walls of your home to save energy on air-conditioning and heating.

We demonstrate the exceptional thermal management capabilities of a large-scale, hierarchal alignment of cellulose nanofibrils directly fabricated from wood, hereafter referred to as nanowood. Nanowood exhibits anisotropic thermal properties with an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.03 W/mK in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the nanofibrils) and approximately two times higher thermal conductivity of 0.06 W/mK in the axial direction due to the hierarchically aligned nanofibrils within the highly porous backbone. The anisotropy of the thermal conductivity enables efficient thermal dissipation along the axial direction, thereby preventing local overheating on the illuminated side while yielding improved thermal insulation along the backside that cannot be obtained with isotropic thermal insulators. The nanowood also shows a low emissivity of 5% over the solar spectrum with the ability to effectively reflect solar thermal energy. Moreover, the nanowood is lightweight yet strong, owing to the effective bonding between the aligned cellulose nanofibrils with a high compressive strength of 13 MPa in the axial direction and 20 MPa in the transverse direction at 75% strain, which exceeds other thermal insulation materials, such as silica and polymer aerogels, Styrofoam, and wool. The excellent thermal management, abundance, biodegradability, high mechanical strength, low mass density, and manufacturing scalability of the nanowood make this material highly attractive for practical thermal insulation applications.

Diagnosed with OCD at 12, but had it since about 7 years old. Diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at \`\`13 years old. Made full recovery by 15, and soon after was deemed almost fully recovered from OCD. Went from being bullied my whole life to having a lot of great friends who supported be through the illness and are my friends to this day. Started smoking weed aged 16, and this became daily at 19. Soon after got into the rave scene and MDMA. Age 18 I took my first psychedelic \(truffles in Amsterdam\) and it was a great trip. Got into acid soon after and loved my new outlook on life. The 4th trip was the one that has never left me. In total I have tripped about 30 times on LSD, 4ACO\-DMT, truffles.  Family history of psychotic disorders, present in my mother and maternal uncle.  It would take knowing me to fully understand what has happened to me. Since being anorexic I had few friends at school and had been away from it for 4 months. When I began to reassemble myself \(loosely, as I still don't know who I am or what my values are\) I found that actually I had all my old friends from childhood and 3 others just waiting to be my friend.  What followed was socially the 5 best years of my life up to now, and it was a high in itself from being bullied for so long. Eventually we all got into drugs. Weed and booze at parties. Eventually the rave scene and mandy were what we moved to. I noticed early that I was different to everyone else, in the way I responded to drugs. I would feel far more guilt about it then any of my friends, thinking this is what bad people do and eventually I would suffer fitting retribution. I became obsessed with my mum's psychotic disorder, and have been pretty much convinced that my drug use would eventually catapult me into insanity.  At uni, one of my friends introduced me to psychs. I had to know what they would do to me. And it turns out I enjoyed them just as well as anyone else, and they became my new favourite.  The bad trip happened with me and 5 of my friends. It was in their new house at uni in a big city, and it was empty and unfurnished. I dropped 300ug and they had 200ug, as it was their first times. I was meant to be the responsible trip sitter/ psychedelically experienced guide. It did not turn out such.  The comeup was normal at first, but so strong compared to the last times. I could sense everyone's nervousness and it infected me. Everyone was just happy and giggly but slightly nervous, but in worrying about them I became the most anxious. From their accounts I descended into a loop of asking every single person by name if they were ok, and then explaining to them why they would be. At some point, my friend, Del lets say, ran outside to meet a driver who was bringing us weed. I was worried about him being hit by a car and watched him the whole way. This is relevant later.  Needless to say the trip was intense with 300 ug and joints being smoked. Visuals were insane. Then the thought loops consumed me. Whilst worrying about everyone's well\-being I began to believe we had lost ourselves in the trip world, that this was a bad batch of acid. The hallucinations began to match this. I saw them all crying and berating me for making everyone go crazy, and we seemed to be stuck in an endless loop of a few minutes we could never get out of. I saw the police arrive and my family's faces crying, and white padded walls. I saw Del jump from a 4th floor window to his death, probably as I was worried about him before. \(He never did this\). I fully believed I had gone crazy and taken everyone else with me.  Woke up in the morning and we were all fine. We laughed it off, but I sensed that things were different between all of us \(they have confirmed everything's fine, but I still get this feeling\)  I carried on tripping after that with no problems, but I never went that intense again. Had no more horror trips on acid, only brief anxiety and fear it would happen again, until one trip at uni where basically the fear came back, and the trip repeated again, and I had the idea that I could have still been tripping ever since the original bad trip, and had in fact gone mad. I was uneasy after this for months and my life fell apart. Anxiety, depression.  Then one night I  ended up taking mandy, and over the night took a full gram. Don't need to tell me how foolish this is. The next day I smoked weed and suddenly the effects of the trip hit me fully, 6 months later. I now was convinced I had been hallucinating this whole world ever since I took acid, and I had ruined my family's lives. It took a couple of weeks and a therapist for me to rationalise everything and believe this world is real.  Now 18 months later I am mostly fine. I have anxiety \(no changes there\), but I'm back at uni. The problem is I had an idea in my head which cannot be proven or disproven. Obviously this world is as real as ever, indicating I'm fine. On the other hand who's to say that that trip didn't catapult me into madness and I'm just hallucinating an exact replica of this world? Sounds mad, and it is. Only other users of psychedelics could grasp what I mean.  The image of my family watching over me in a white padded room I think will haunt me for ever. I hope one day I can fully accept this world, as deep down I know it's real.

I am a game designer, and I just finished the final iteration of my first game -  Forsaken Forest . This is a pet project - I am the sole developer, but I do plan on launching a Kickstarter campaign and eventually bringing this to market.   I'm looking for multiple self motivated artists to tackle multiple pieces each. The game has over 100 different cards. Each card has  filler art  with a similar direction to what I'm looking for, along with art direction in text form.   While the game aims to maintain a dark, salem witch trials/lovecraftian style, I am very open to experimenting if you have a particularly appealing take on things.   Per usual, please reply with a link to some samples of your work and we can talk about what cards fit your style best. I will share the art/cards with you upon request.   Hope to hear from you!       Game Description:   In the dead of winter, a group of selfless townsfolk has set forth on a journey to a neighboring town to gather resources for their starving village. On the way back from retrieving the supplies, they must cross through a perilous, maze-like forest. Within the Forsaken Forest awaits an ancient evil, just waiting for new  playthings to enter.   Forsaken Forest takes place in a dark and mysterious forest, filled with terrifying evil and and unknown dangers. The woods itself plays a key role in the game, as it just so happens that it is sentient and extremely angry.  If the deadly cold and numerous dangers of the forest was not enough, there is a cruel twist of fate: not all of the villagers are who they say they are   they are not humans, but Werewolves.

We have some of the highest level crafters in the PTS that have organized a crafting system to ensure our guild has access to the top level equipment sets as soon as possible.

We will likely ask you friendly questions and one of our leaders will make a decision on your app. The application process may seem antiquated, but its served us well over the last fifteen years and really helps us get to know people coming in. We spend more effort than any guild I know of to find good people, bring them in and integrate them into our community.

","content":"  If you're not familiar with the case, here's a quick summary from the original discussion:  Andrew Gosden's disappearance, at first glance, looks like the typical case of a run away. He left for school and waited until he knew his parents had left the house, then changed out of his school uniform and into casual clothes. After this, he withdrew 200 from his bank account and headed to the local train station, buying a one way ticket to London. He specifically asked for the one way ticket, even though the ticket seller told him that a return ticket was only 50p more. Andrew didn't have a cell phone or an email address, and police were unable to find evidence that he had planned his trip on his home, school, or library computers. This disappearance was very out of character for Andrew, he had a previously perfect attendance record at school. The search for Andrew has included searching the Thames River for his body, and his father going to a concert held by Andrew's favorite band, Muse.   This case really sticks in my mind - there's a huge billboard on the platform of the train station, where I wait for my train every morning. I see it every day and his image really sticks with me, does anyone know of any developments in the case? or if it's just cold?

","content":"  I said as much on the CD Projekt Red forums, but I think I can strike up another conversation here.   It was by pure coincidence that I thought about this while playing another CDPR game The Witcher. Almost every sandbox game I've ever played fell under these categories:   * Contemporary crime. The likes of: GTA; Saints Row; Sleeping Dogs; Watch_Dogs; Driver * Historical. The likes of: Red Dead: Redemption; Mafia; The Saboteur; The Godfather; Assassin's Creed * Military/Mercenary. The likes of: Mercenaries; Just Cause * Survival/Crafting. The likes of: Far Cry; Minecraft; DayZ; Dead Rising; Horizon: Zero Dawn * Space Exploration. The likes of: Elite: Dangerous; No Man's Sky; EVE: Valkyrie * Fantasy. Name just about any big fantasy RPG in the past 20 years; start with The Elder Scrolls, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, The Witcher, and keep on moving.  At the time, when I tried thinking of sci-fi games in the open world genre, the only one that really came to mind was the Crackdown series and that was only nominally sci-fi. Since then, I've looked into the matter and discovered that there have been more sci-fi open world games... but in most cases, you had to really stretch it to compare them to the likes of, say, GTA, but were not really  straight  science fiction. Red Faction: Guerrilla and Fallout are sci-fi games, without question. And yes, they definitely have more natural world than cityscapes too much so, in fact. Guerrilla was basically a stripped down Red Dead: Redemption on Mars, with so few actual large settlements as to make the whole place feel sparse (which I guess worked with the themes, and the game did have to wrestle with making every single object destructible). Fallout has a lot of retro sci-fi elements, but again, it's post-apocalyptic more than anything. Borderlands also counts, but it was more akin to Fallout than that GTA style I've been looking for. And most recently, there's been Horizon: Zero Dawn.   And yet it was with Horizon: Zero Dawn that yet another realization dawned on me just about every sci-fi sandbox tends to be an open world survival/crafting game. Far Cry set in the future, in other words.   What is it about the GTA/Saints Row setting that interests me so much that I want a game in that style? I guess it's more a desire to see it done that way. As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to play a game like *Grand Theft Auto* set in a cyberpunk-style world. In fact, I can take it back to 2000 when I was playing *Perfect Dark* and grew fascinated with that setting, wishing I could somehow  step out  of the level boundaries.   I wanted the world to not be post-apocalyptic or post-civilization. At most, let it be pre-apocalyptic.    If Cyberpunk 2077 is that game, oh I'd be so happy. Even if it isn't, I'll still enjoy it I don't have a problem with the aforementioned games at all. I just hope that, sometime before I can feed words into an AI and get a custom-made game spat back out, there's some attempt at this style.   _____________________  Post-script: Let me add that there *have* been a few  cyberpunk  or  dystopian sci-fi  open world games as of late. But they were utter shite. Those games being Homefront: The Revolution and Mirror's Edge: Catalyst. Catalyst was a true blow to the throat because it was an open world first person parkour game in a cyberpunk setting a niche I wanted scratched for the sunny side of a decade. When it wound up being a mediocre pile, the disappointment I felt was legendary.  Jak II was sort of like a lite-version of what I was looking for. Watch_Dogs 2 is probably the closest any game has yet come. "},{"id":209113,"number":0,"nick": "subject8213","redditor":188283,"title":" Premium and non premium cars ","content":" Which are which?

Revelations Liaoning fabricated statistics raise questions over rest of rust belt  Women ride past oil wells in northern China's Hebei province  AFP  4 HOURS AGO by: Lucy Hornby and Archie Zhang in Beijing and Jane Pong in Hong Kong Sceptics about Chinaseconomic statistics have taken a special pleasure in revelations offaked data in the north-eastern province of Liaoning dating at least to 2011. Along with an officially reported contraction in its economy last year, they have given the impression that Liaonings economy is unusually troubled. That impression may be unfair to Liaoning.   In 2007 when he was party secretary of Liaoning, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made waves when he declared Chinas gross domestic productfigures man-made.  Even president Xi Jinping weighed in on Liaonings data-faking last week, telling the provinces delegation to Chinas annual legislative meeting that the practice must be stopped.   But is Liaoning the only province to have doctored its statistics? The map below shows the share of metals and mining (a category that includes crude oil output) in the nominal gross domestic product of Chinese provinces in 2011. China stopped publishing this data in 2012, the same year the commodity cycle turned sour.   The FT examined four provinces that are more reliant than Liaoning on the coal, steel and oil industries. Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia comprise Chinas coal heartland; Liaoning and Hebei together account for almost one-third of Chinas steel output.  In regions where resources or steel dominate, the commodity cycle is more extreme. Booms inflate the service sector, consumer spending and property prices; busts have an outsized effect on employment and government finances. China has a rust belt just like the US or UK, says Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia.  Here is a look at coal, oil and steel prices since 2012.   These benchmarks were multiplied by each provinces reported output of coal, oil and steel, and charted against the reported growth in GDP. Here is Liaoning. Strangely, when it admitted to a contraction in 2016, steel, coal and oil were already recovering.   The other provinces show a similar pattern in the three key industries. Output values weakened in 2012, briefly recovered in the second half of 2013 and then took a deep dive. Here is Hebei, home to one-quarter of Chinese steel production:   The worse period was the winter of 2015-2016, followed by a recovery in 2016, as we can see in Shaanxi...   ...and Inner Mongolia...   This pattern diverges from reported GDP figures, which show growth speeding up from early 2015. Heres Shanxi, the most mining-dependent of all Chinese provinces. Metals and mining (mostly coal) made up 62 per cent of its industrial output in 2011, and 37 per cent of GDP.   Did Liaoning actually underperform last year, or were its reported data suddenly brought back in line with reality? And what does that imply about the other rust-belt provinces?    Liaoning is the most developed and diversified of the three north-eastern provinces, therefore it should have been performing better, not worse, says Andrew Batson, economist at research group Gavekal Dragonomics who keeps a close eye on the economy in Chinas beleaguerednorth-eastern provinces.  In 2013 the Communist party pledged to implement a unified system for compiling provincial GDP. Rather than relying on provincial agencies to produce GDP figures in parallel with the national survey, the pledge called for the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing to take charge of the process.  The goal was to avoid the perennial problem of provincial GDPs summing up to a higher number than the national figure. NBS circulated a draft plan for the unified system in late 2014. Ning Jizhe, director of NBS, told official media on Sunday that phase-in will begin in 2017 and be complete by 2020.  Observers must await the release of four years of corrected data from Liaoning  if indeed the true numbers are ever divulged  if they are to find out what really happened to northern Chinas economy when the economic books were being cooked.

May I Rant? ","content":"  Hi all! I was sent here by a helpful soul after my DH posted a few of our woes on r/raisedbynarcissists. My  MIL is pretty much unequivocally nuts and apparently, this is the place to rant about that sort of thing. A bit of background before we begin, DH and I have two lovely girls by biology and adoption, and we are also current foster parents. Any parenting requires protecting your kids, but foster parenting even more so, because traumatized munchkins are extra-fragile. For this reason and others, we have been LC from toxic MIL for several years and went total NC in June.   So today I was chilling on facebook, like ya do, and up popped a message from my DH's Aunt L. I like Aunt L quite a bit, but as she and I don't exactly talk much, I was surprised to hear from her. She basically said   Hi subject3796, I heard a rumor that you guys have a new boy! I don't want to be rude or pry, but I just wanted to offer congratulations if that is true  Now, we do indeed have a new kiddo, but since he's still in foster care, I can't legally say much about it without breaking a bunch of confidentiality laws. I let her know as much and it's all good, but something is nagging at the back of my brain. Where did she hear a  rumor  about our boy? We don't tell many people about our kids, for reasons stated above. Plus, it'd be awkward to announce a new kid, only to have someone ask you about them two months later and have to say that they moved out/reunified/got adopted etc.  So, where did sweet Aunt L hear this rumor? Apparently, somehow, my narcissist MIL found out about our boy. This has led to a flood of facebook posts so impressive that it would have Noah packing up the animals. For example:   My daughter in law and my son have cut off all contact with (FIL) and I and blocked us on facebbok. We are heartbroken and we don't understand why, but we just want them to be happy. *picture of a heart being shattered by a hammer*   Does she not understand plain english? We told her straight out that she is acting in a toxic manner and we would not resume contact until that changed. We told her this in June. Nothing has changed. Also:   Just found out that subject3796 and my son have a boy now? I don't know the details, but  I guess I'm a Grammie again? They cut off all contact with me but if anyone is still talking to them please tell them I said congratulations and tag them so they see this post!  Ew ew ew, she has sicced the flying monkeys on us! I HATE it when she's so creepy and passive aggressive.   There were of course, many more icky things said. I found myself literally physically ill at some of it. It was almost as bad as the time she sent all of our kids inappropriate, random gifts in an attempt to pacify DH and I into breaking NC. Anyways, sorry for the novel of a first post, I just have no one else to talk to about all this and I'm going insane.   TL;DR - MIL bombs facebook with creepy posts about our new foster kid and our going NC.   EDIT: Thanks everyone for rhe replies! A lot of people have asked about our experiences with foster care, so I'd just like to say that anyone who is interested in more information should feel free to message me about it. I like talking about foster care more than I like thinking about my crazy MIL lol.

","content":"  I have been following guides and calculators and whatnot for what to level up and when to ascend and everything for idling efficiency.  The fruit of my labor is an acceptable run-time to level 135-140ish considering the point of the game I'm at (It currently takes about 20-25 minutes if I sit on top of it). However, despite spending enough time in front of the computer to babysit the game for at least several ascensions a day I don't always attend to it due to doing other things with my time.  Now, this is really only a problem because it rubs my want for efficiency the wrong way, since what often happens is I let the game sit at level 40 or 70 or whatever it lands on while I'm doing something else, and therefore I waste a lot of time for little return (The last idling game I played was Derivative Clicker which of course needs attention but it spawns buildings based on higher tier things so once you're in the slower parts of the game it requires significantly less attention than Clicker Heroes). Anyway, what I come to ask for is if there is some happy medium between doing the most efficient rapid ascensions and the very slow (And, at my level, somewhat impossible) Deep(er) Runs. Also, and I expect less from this question so no worries if there's no good advice on this, is there a way to make beginning each ascension less overwhelming (i.e. It is somewhat efficient once you're going X fast to wait the extra time to purchase 10x / 25x / what-have-you of each hero instead of the traditional level up 10 times, get the upgrade, move on to the next, then backtrack after a bit to get upgrades)?

The truth is that I am scared to be flamed mindlessly simply because I'm a child. When I'm with friends I am usually ignored or shot down first thing I say because I am younger than most people I try to make friends with and people who are older can't even conceive the thought and even being remotely nice to someone who has been targeted as a squeaker and  Faggot .  But it isn't just because of the roasting and mindless aggression but it is because people act much differently whenever I use my mic and try to coordinate a push or just have a good time. They have made fun of what gender I am and poke fun at pedophilia and rape of small children, even on occasion they had a debate on if they raped my dead corpse if it was Pedophilia, Necrophilia, or both. That is why I refuse to use my mic because it is accepted and encouraged to attack young children no matter what they do or say and overall I find it that I have much better relationships with other if I don't use my mic and use chat because they hate that I am a squeaker (not even that rude) and try to make my time there a living hell.

I literally made this an hour ago, and have just been lurking this whole time haha   I'm 20 years old, and currently working and going to school.  I first started noticing something was wrong with my relationship with food when I was 13. At that time I was probably around 4'11  and weighed 130 pounds. My parents had gotten a divorce two years earlier, and I had just moved in with my dad.  He was very strict about healthy eating, and would have my sister and I weigh ourselves daily.  That's kind of where the rituals started. I was already weighing myself everyday, and I would notice on days that I ate less, I'd be two to three pounds lighter.  Well, that's easy, eat a little less, weigh less   But then it turned into almost a competition of how long I could go without eating. I guess because it was the only control I had, and I was tired of being the awkward/chubby girl.  I plateaued at 111 pounds about a year later. And that's when I started plastering my walls with pictures of thin girls, keeping a diary of what I was allowed/did eat that day. I also ate in secret. I don't know why I felt embarrassed to eat in front of my family, they never told me I couldn't, or asked why I ate so much, or anything to that extent. Presumably, I was just ashamed of myself.  Then I would binge eat when everyone went to bed. Then I would purge in the shower, because it made me feel cleaner, I suppose.   I even started abusing stimulant laxatives, and that lead to my gull bladder being removed and being put in therapy at age 16.  I've been in recovery, with little to no anorexic/bulimic/binge eating rituals or tendencies for three years.  But just recently, I broke up with a really shitty boyfriend, and met an awesome guy. Except, he's into skinny, fit girls. And now, I'm not either. I've already started to cut back what I can eat. I've already started a meal planning and calorie counting diary, and I know my old habits are coming back. Which, part of me is really glad for, because part of it is so therapeutic (as ironic as it sounds) to have control, and to feel powerful when you succeed in saying no to all your temptations.  But the part of me that went to therapy is telling myself how unhealthy it is, how much my family loves me and doesn't want to see me do this to myself again.  And I live with my new boyfriend, and I'm afraid he will find out. I don't need him thinking I'm too messed up to be with, or it's just too much to deal with in a new relationship.  But I want this so bad. I guess I just need confirmation that it's okay to not be okay. That I don't have to be ready to fix myself.   Sorry for how long this is, especially as a new user. Just the last month has been me thinking all these things, and no one to talk to.

I have few questions basically related to your philanthrophy work and one on technology.  1. Omni Processor is a great innovation. But it seems it is currently an industrial product from a company, Janicki Bioenergy. This is fine, but don't you feel a model to build the processor on same/smaller scale should be provided. I am saying this because if such is available, many small villages might be able build this by themselves with local resources available to them (or within budget they can afford). I would really like to have your thoughts on this.  2. Gates Foundation works really hard on lot of health issues. From Combodia to India and from Malaria to Polio, you are doing good job. But do you really think the fight should rely on a private foundation. There is a need of self sustainable efficient system to fight any disease, to which private foundation may or may not contribute. My question to you is, are you engaging with Local Govt bodies or International bodies to develop such system?  3. My last question is related to Microsoft Research. Recently Microsoft closed Silicon Valley research lab, is this towards a reshaping of research inside Microsoft or Microsoft is narrowing the research focus? Another question which might not concern you, but still want to ask, are you aware of recent Qualcomm campaign regarding new IEEE patent policies(under consideration). Any comments on that?

A couple of weeks ago,  I will take your cat to play in traffic.  - my cat is my life. I love him more than she's ever loved us, and she told me she was going to kill him. My cat and my boyfriend are the reason I am alive today, and continue living, and she knows this.    It's so good you lost weight.  I lost weight due to Anorexia. She brags about my weightloss to other people, not telling them I was/am so incredibly ill, so that other people then make comments about my loss (positively), which I've explained just makes it worse. She then also compared that I wasn't as thin as other people my age.   My last super-bad one -  I wish you were like your cousin, had a baby when you were 17. At least then you'd be WORTH something. Least you'd have DONE something.   And the rest...  You'll never have anything. You'll be lazy your whole life, like your father.  - father actually works ridiculously hard.   When I spoke about wanting to move overseas to be with my partner,  That won't work, you will hate the country, you won't be able to get medical treatment, you'll work a dead-end job your whole life.    I bet your Anorexia is MY fault. , while ranting about her 'woe is me'.   I wish I'd never had more than one kid.  (that kid being my older sister, who also displays N traits)   I wish I'd never had kids.    You'll always be a sponge.  I'm mentally ill - Anorexia and life-crippling anxiety (hardly leave house, don't answer phone, hardly talk to new people). I have to live with parents until I can support myself again, because I'm so ill.    You never complete anything, and you never WILL complete anything  in relation to me changing study areas all the time.    You think YOU have anxiety?! I HAVE ANXIETY AND I STILL FUNCTION.  completely degrades my feelings and illness with this. They don't have anxiety as far as I know.    I'm going to move out and not have anything to do with you fuckers.   And then the gaslighting...  Won't you come see me when I move out? Why not? Will you come visit me?     You can come stay with me... for $20 a night.  - to my brother. But neither of us are welcome to actually *live* with her.   Your cat's sick because you went overseas.  My cat is sick because she constantly screams at us in fits of rage, and it freaks him out. He's got anxiety from it. My vet offered Prozac... for my cat.   Who will look after the dogs when I move out? No-one? Looks like we'll have to get them put down.  - talking about our very much beloved dogs, who are no older than 6 years old.   You're nothing like the girls I work with, they are nothing like you! They have their lives together! What do you have? NOTHING. You're so lazy. You do NOTHING. You could have a job if you want, these girls go out and apply for jobs EVERYWHERE. YOU DON'T.

","content":"  I have a story that that I think will fit this subreddit nicely. It took place a few years ago.   One summer I went with my girlfriend to stay with her family for the weekend. They live in a rural New England community, right next to a fairly large lake. Naturally, they spend a lot of time on the lake during the summer and that's mostly what we did over the weekend.  One afternoon we went battle-tubing with some of her family's friends. For those who don't know what that is; battle-tubing is when you tow two tubes from a wakeboarding boat, and the people being towed try to knock each other off their tubes. It can be pretty difficult to stay on the tube without someone trying to knock you off as you're being dragged through the water at about 35 mph.  Anyway, we had just turned around to collect the two tubers who had just fallen off in a particularly wide open part of the lake. We decided to take a break for a few minutes and just swim by the boat. The water was pretty deep there, not sure how deep but I couldn't see the bottom.  Now it's important to mention that my girlfriend isn't afraid of deep water, but she is afraid of big fish. It's also important to know that I'm a jerk. I always try to sneak up on her underwater and grab her, but I never get away with it, she always sees me coming. But this water was particularly dark and deep.  I remember realizing at one point that no one was paying attention to me and thinking  this is perfect . I quietly sank under the water and dove down until I could just barely see the surface. I've spent almost every summer day of my life in the water since I was little, so I'm comfortable with diving down and I can hold my breath for a pretty long time. I only had to go about 8 or 10 feet down, the water was pretty dark and murky. I also couldn't see the bottom, I'm still not sure just how deep that part of the lake is. I had gotten an idea of which direction she was in before diving as I knew I wouldn't be able to see well down there. I just swam in that direction until I could see feet kicking above me, and picked out feet I was pretty sure were hers. Once I was under her I swam up and grabbed her ankle. I still couldn't see that well even close by, but she just kicked away and I couldn't hear anything, so I figured I hadn't fooled her. Still, I decided to just wait down there for another 15 seconds, I thought maybe that would convince her it hadn't been me. When I eventually did come up everyone looked at me and started laughing, all except my girlfriend who looked pissed. Apparently she didn't know it was me and had screamed at the top of her lungs, I was just so deep under the water I couldn't hear it. However, I had stayed down so long she had realized I wasn't there and it must have been me, and she was afraid she had kicked me in the head, knocking me out. So I ended up giving everyone a scare until I came up, which I did feel bad about. But in the end it did make for a funny story.

So in August 1977, a strong narrowband radio signal was received by The Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope, in the United States, then assigned to a SETI project. The signal appeared to come from the constellation Sagittarius and bore the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.  For more information visit the Wikipedia page:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal  So somebody on youtube converted the signal into sound and it sounded like high pitched tones. Here is the recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkycNvrpjCs  As I was browsing youtube researching the Wow! signal I came across a video of a dude claiming that he  decoded  the signal. The video was showing him speeding up the recording x16 with fl studio and making out a voice (Which sounded like a policeman talking through an police intercom)  Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XWMJ4tgts  At first I was skeptical, I thought it would be really easy to make a hoax like this, so i decided to try it for myself with audacity and it turns out it is actually true! Just use a sound editing tool to speed up the recording by 16, you'll hear it. It's pretty difficult to understand what the policeman is saying but I'm almost sure he ends by saying  61 . Reply to tell me what you think.  Cheers!  Just a quick update: I cleared the audio a little using noise reduction. I'm still not really sure what it says but it sounds like:  We lost him and 17 PM at the ??? 61 the 61(stops abruptly)  "},{"id":322587,"number":0,"nick": "subject1787","redditor":297539,"title":" Disneyland Price Hike ","content":"  "},{"id":323643,"number":0,"nick": "subject4502","redditor":297540,"title":"   ","content":"  I was thinking more along the lines of  Battlecry: give your opponent a mana crystal, Battlecry: summon two 1/1 whelps for your opponent  ;)  This card also has synergy with injured blademaster "},{"id":323861,"number":0,"nick": "subject1292","redditor":297541,"title":"   ","content":"  That even though there are shitty, disgusting, vile human beings out there...they are no greater than I as a human and I am no greater than them.

It would make a major difference. ","content":"  There is an argument to be made that the best moderator in the history of Reddit is /u/Kylde.   Who is Kylde?  Currently he is a mod of the default subreddits /r/funny (where he is also top-mod), /r/todayilearned, /r/news, and /r/television.    He also previously modded several other default (or former default) subreddits such as /r/Pics, /r/Technology, /r/WTF, and several others.    The only reason he still doesn't mod more than four defaults is because that is against the rules of Reddit now.  A few years ago the Admins created a rule against moderators modding more than four defaults.    That was because there there were then several very inactive moderators who were modding a lot more than four of them.  As such, the Admins intervened to restrict the influence of the do-nothing mods.     Still, at the time, even the Admins recognized the value of having Kylde be a mod of several defaults and granted him a waiver from the rule.  That waiver was then withdrawn about six months later.  So Kylde became a mere power-mod once again and had to make his hard choices.    But more importantly, he's been the #1 Spam Fighter on Reddit for years now.   He has done something on the order of 600,000 spam and rts reports.  /r/ReportTheSpammers was the previously spam fighting subreddit before the Admins created /r/Spam.   Kydle was a mod there and was the center of the spam fighting team that actively hunted down spammers.     To put the 600,000 spam reports into perspective, that's more anti-spam work than the next top-10 spam fighters on Reddit combined.   The number two person has done about 250,000 spam reports.    He was hailed by the Reddit Community and the Admins as the Best Moderator of 2010.   I have not always agreed with Kylde.  We sometimes have butted heads.   But I've never lost respect for him.   He's a great moderator and knows more about fighting spam on Reddit than anyone else, bar none.   As such the Admins should hire him and give him money to combat spam professionally.  Then as an admin he would be able to reach into the Spam filters of any subreddit in search of the rich Spam veins and root out all of the bad and worst spammers.  Anyway, that's my Idea for the Admins.   I'm sure this would make a major difference and improve Reddit immeasurably.

","content":"  I'd been getting Colba's ADSL2+ service at my old place, but when I moved 2 years ago I was told that my new apartment building was far from the Bell CO (Central Office) in my area, and because of that I would get a very slow download speed. Colba suggested that I switch to their cable Internet access (provided by Videotron). I did, and was happy with the service. Consistently 10.00 to 10.50 Mbps download, 1.00 to 1.50 upload speed (I had their 10 Mbps download, 1 Mbps upload package). At my old place with ADSL2+ I got around 8 Mbps download, less than 1 Mbps upload. Last week I got an email from Colba. They're discontinuing their cable Internet service as of September 30. Part of the email they sent me reads:    ColbaNet has been offering cable internet service through a partnership with another telecommunications company.  However, a third party has acquired this partner, which obligates us to stop offering this cable internet service as of September 30th 2016 .  Since ADSL2+ isn't really an option for me, I'm being switched to what on their website they call fiber-ADSL. It's actually Bell's  Bell Fibe  Internet service that Colba purchases from Bell. I'm supposed to be getting the same speed as with the cable service, and my monthly transfer usage has increased from 250 GB to 300 GB. Cable service cost me $39.95 a month, fiber-ADSL will be $37.95. They've also couriered me a free modem (they usually charge $59.99 for the modem). The switch is supposed to be taking place tomorrow. A Bell technician will be coming to my place tomorrow to complete the installation and check the speed of the line.  Has anyone had Colba's fiber-ADSL service? If so, how is (or was...) it?

So I bought the Nexus 6P. However during the last 6 months I have encountered few issues. It is slower than the S7 Edge even after installing Pure Nexus rom. Battery life is extremely bad but I am not having the famous battery problem. Best thing on this phone is the camera, way better than the camera on the S7. While speakers are great one of the speakers seems to be louder than the other. Naturally I am looking in other options at the moment and I really don't feel like buying another android.

To my surprise it works really well, makes a really good cup of coffee. I've brewed an Ethiopian natural process on it a few times and have noted a smooth mouth feel with plenty of sweetness. Also great over ice. The convenience of an electric kettle with the quality and fun-to-watchness of a siphon. I'll be putting down my v60 and aeropress for a while and play around with this thing.   A few questions:   Can anyone actually tell me anything about it? How old it is? How much it might be worth?  Also, any suggestions on dosage and grind size. On the one hand as you can see the brew cycle isn't very long. On the other hand, the filter is like a mesh type deal, so I don't want to go too long.  Also, when should I pull the top off? After the initial  flush  of the vacuum about 2/3 of the coffee is returned to the lower chamber. I'm wondering how long I should let the rest seep out through the grounds before I cut it. If I leave it on to let every last drip drop out I assume I'll be inviting some bitterness into the cup? Although on the other hand, I'd like to get more than 2/3 coffee back on my brew. Thanks all!

Even the titles Hearts/Wires, Wires/Hearts serves as a middle point to flip the sand glass seems intentional from the band. A figure eight or a circle, we all come to the middle and end only to end at the beginning.  It seems far to coincidental in listening from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning that Gore is able to create totally different artistic directions. Hey this may be stretch but I feel the band appreciates its audience's intelligence and attention to detail.

Food is repulsive no matter what. Doctor's won't believe me because my bodyweight is normal.  I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, but /r/eatingdisorders requires preapproval, and I'm losing patience...    I began bodybuilding as a hobby at the age of 19 and quickly fell in love. I was always the short, skinny kid that got called a stick and suffered from extremely low self esteem.  My hobby quickly turned to an obsession; wake up, microwave some quick oats and chug a protein shake, then head to work. Whenever I could, I was on my phone or computer, scrolling through bodybuilders social media pages envisioning myself, one day having that perfect body. Nothing was going to stop me.  I spend countless hours researching the best foods to gain muscle and minimize fat. Soon enough, I began tracking my macronutrients and calories, and eventually I stopped eating out with coworkers and friends because I got extreme anxiety when I was eating junk or when not eating enough bodybuilding foods. My life was fueled strictly, and boy do I mean strictly, by Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, chicken breast, rice, eggs, protein shakes, and nuts.   As the days went by and the months grew longer, I sat in my room, denying the agony and chewing like a cow thinking that one day Ill be the perfect physique, and that no one can stop me.  Everyday after work I would rush to the gym, then after the gym, I would rush to my room to refuel to make sure I hit the anabolic window. I would walk as fast as I could from my car to my room and threw slabs of chicken breast on a pan and prepped minute rice. I drink a quick protein shake, then I start eating. An hour and a half goes by. I no longer have an appetite, and I no longer have the desire to eat, but I start working my jaw and power through like a garbage truck.   Days go by, my relationship with coworkers and friends begin to deteriorate as I force myself to stay home. No alcohol either. The phrase was branded on my skin, engraved in my brain, and chiseled on my soul. Diet is everything if you want to look like them.   The days go by, and soon, dinner starts to take 1, no 2, no 3 hours to finish. I start being late to work because Im finding it harder to choke down egg whites and oatmeal. But I do it anyways, because diet = having the perfect body.   Then months go by; I start to notice..why am I not hungry? 2 years later, I realize that I havent felt hungry for quite a while. I ask a friend of mine who is a nurse. The first thing she asked was, uhh, well, are you depressed? I laughed and said,  No, I probably just suck at cooking, knowing damn well that both were true.   Fast forward, almost 4 years later. I start college a bit later than most people. Still going to the gym at least 5 days a week, but with one keen difference; food has become my enemy. I do everything in my power to not gag at the thought of food, but I force myself to eat, no matter how miserable it made me feel. My thoughts are no longer centric to appearance, I tell myself to eat or else I will be irritated, fatigued, and unfocused for the rest of my life. School is becoming increasingly more difficult. Some days I feel dizzy like Im going to pass out, other days Ill reluctantly eat a bagel for the entire day and feel fine. But one thing remains the same. My stomach no longer says I want to eat. My stomach hasnt said a word in almost 3 years. The adult in me grabs a spoon and begins to force whatevers it can down my throat. The adult in me breaks the strict dieting and reintroduces foods that should taste good, but I still am repulsed.   **Eating has become a battle for me for almost 3 years now. Out of habit, Im able to go to the gym still even though my performance has severely declined. Ive been eating a lot less healthy to try and revive my loss of appetite, but nothing seems to work. I havent felt hungry for years. Ive talked to a doctor; he said it sounds like I have anorexia, but that I should just try to stop overthinking it since my body weight is fine. Ive called multiple psychiatric facilities and they all either tell me they are not accepting new patients, or they will ask me how much weight I lost (my weight is always plus or minus 5 pounds), but after I tell them my weight, they act as if Im making things up.**  I really need help, but no one believes me. I told my girlfriend and she doesnt take it seriously. When I tell other people, they just go man you are lucky, that sounds like a blessing. This kills me because they have no idea how its like to be absolutely repulsed by food, not just certain foods, but literally everything meant to be ingested. I feel like Im slowly losing my mind because of this. People think there is something wrong with me because I never go out (usually entails eating in a social setting) and I dont want to always be the guy taking 3 hours to finish his first plate of food, looking like its disgusting.   If someone out there can just at least understand my situation it would mean the world to me. Im really afraid that I will be stuck like this forever. Ive been considering to just stop eating for a week (as I know this would be easily a a achievable) if thats what it takes to get help...    I need help, what can I do?

One evening while trying to just mind my own business, pretending to be pleasant to people, a couple of girls my age (working this job as a Junior in college) come in and get in line.   These girls were absolutely nothing special; actually grabbing my attention because of the exact opposite. I looked up from scooping ice cream to see what caused me to blink twice then caused me to visibly shudder. This girl was missing one of her front teeth! I quivered in fear at the sight of her missing bicuspid. I made her ice cream silently and kept my eyes off of her. Something in the way she looked at me made me think that this girl was trying to start talking to me and I didn't want to have to attempt to make any conversation because I knew that I wouldn't have been able to keep my eyes off that gaping hole. As I moved towards the register to ring her up she made some comment but I was too busy typing her order into the register and didn't hear.   I looked up, handed the change over and if you wouldn't believe it she was grinning from ear to ear again. Sitting there gazing at this cartoon faced college co-ed I just smiled back and turned away.   Next I helped her friend in line. When I go to ring up the friend she says to me that her friend (toothless wonder) thinks that I am cute and wants to have my number.   I froze up. My face got red. I looked up attempting not to say anything that would make me seem like an asshole. There was nothing that I could have said that wasn't going to make my rejection of her toothless amigo any nicer. My response couldn't have been any more awkward and obvious of my complete disgust. I spit out that I had a girlfriend. Toothless overheard, walks up to the register and says yeah, ok and then walks away.   i still don't know which of us felt worse. I clearly wasn't attracted but she pushed it, placing me in a very awkward situation. No response other than being polite and giving it to her (didn't have time to think about giving her a fake one) would have worked.   TL:DR Toothless girl hit on me at work and I had denied and awkwardness bomb exploded "},{"id":393584,"number":0,"nick": "subject6941","redditor":365339,"title":"   ","content":" Looper, probably cause I don't live in Shanghai or have a blunderbuss.

That, I think is a good and bad thing - good bc the facial hair absolutely rocks, bad bc it drives my eyes to the lower half of your art, and when I stop to think about that, it feels odd; it's like while talking to a person, my eye wanders down to their lips and stay there instead of looking at the eyes. Also, your chin hair seems to be more thoroughly thought out than the stache. That chin portion is AMAZING.   Secondly, I really adore your style.

For example the chin has to line up with the upper lip, but for a male a slightly lager chin is still considered pleasing to the eye, where for a female a slightly smaller chin can also still be considered attractive. Small waist and bigger hips are a sign of fertility to men, so also considered attractive. Clear skin is a sign of health and thus also considered attractive, and so are teeth (too straight teeth can resemble dentures so I personally find slightly larger front teeth better looking.

I've tried messaging the mods about it, but I haven't heard back yet.  Sorry if this post is against the rules.  I'm using an Acer C710-2856 and I've been playing around with some of my options.  Because the SSD is so small (16g total, so about 9.5 available after the ChromeOS), I've decided I want to run ChrUbuntu off of my 1TB Passport external hard drive.    Before I decided on using an external drive, I tried a few of the different scripts on the ChrUbuntu blog.  The 'tnyga' script didn't work for my machine, but I did get the 's9ryd' script to install.    The blog entry for installing to a USB external drive is very straight forward and was easy to follow.  I used the 'tnyga' script the first time, but the install didn't work and my machine wouldn't boot into ChrUbuntu from the OS Verification screen.  However, when I run the same method with the 's9ryd' script, I get a prompt to partition the drive for Ubuntu.  It suggests 5-10 gigs and says 9 is the recommended maximum.  This is the exact same message I get when installing on the internal SSD.  I thought it wanted to partition my External, so I tried inputting 950g, but it said the entered value exceeded the available space.  * Am I doing something wrong in the install process? * Should I be using a different script?  * Is this machine just not compatible with installation to a USB External?

What bugs people is that these women were fired for being women and otherwise forced to return to the domestic. Men had a choice to refuse to serve and the many histories on pacifism reflect that. At the same time, it's also not true that the trauma has been ignored. The Modernist and Surrealist authors and painters, for instance, wrote eloquently and often about what it cost men to go and fight.  The problem of women being forced out of independence and work after WWII may be becoming a bid deal now, but you're just not representing cultural history accurately in you claim that it is predominant in the discussion of WWII history. The male perspective shaped almost all documentary and historical coverage of WWII and its aftermath. Look at Ken Burns as an example. Or almost any history book. The story of these women is almost always a footnote in anything published before 2000. This is the basis of the claim that its important to focus on this side of the story now.

He smoothed out a seam in his suit, very noticeably not looking to the man sitting on his left. He was sitting upright and cleared his throat very quietly, dignified and regal. He wore an old suit with a handkerchief in the top left pocket and white trousers, all well ironed and kept. He was an older gentleman with white hair and a light beard and mustache. His smile was warm and his whole appearance brought to mind a well groomed Duke from the countryside. The only mark that might have clued people in to the truth of him was the long jagged scar on the left of his face passing over his lip, and all scars have a story. Jeremys made good friends in his school. We dont let him invite them to visit him, but he knows why. Jeremiah wrung his hands together and broke eye contact. He hasnt forgiven me and only barely talks to me. Hes not a spoiled child, its justeven children know there are some things you cant forgive. 	When the brief but violent period of the blue light had ended, all those who had gained and then lost their powers had had the chance to be inducted back into their former lives, after rehabilitation and punishment. Jeremiahs son was protected under the unaffiliated persons act sprung up to protect the identity of family members of people who had temporarily gained powers and used them to commit crime. Jeremiah The Cat Harkins had used his powers to phase through walls to rob banks and jewelry stores and had ultimately been the least of the ultra criminals that had arisen during this period. 	However when the people live in fear of people who can murder with a touch of their finger, can turn buildings to dust in moments, and set entire areas ablaze with a thought, even the least of these people are hated. Especially when during this same period there were those who gave their lives and health to protect, people like Bob Superman Sall. 	Bob did not seem fazed by Jeremiahs pain. He sat back, slouched in his chair, one foot over the small table in the center of the room. His eyes were cold and distant, his thoughts even now after months of therapy still a mystery. His face looked empty, almost as though unaccustomed to lacking the rage he had born as a hero. 	Have you considered bringing him here? Perhaps you can bring your wife as well? I said, Youre paying your dues, and even your probation-even Todd can vouch for your good behavior. 	People recognize me, they recognizethis, Jeremiah said, tenderly touching the scar. Unconsciously Bob reached up and touched the equal scar on his own face. 	What if a hero spoke to your son? I said, Someone loved and respected by the community, someone even your sons friends would respect? 	Jeremiah grimaced, still not looking at Bob, and said, You mean maybe the man who nearly beat me to death? and then indicated the scar and continued, The man who gave me this? 	The mark of the guilty the people had called it. Jeremiah was neither the first nor the last to bear it. 	Tom Peterson usually gives lectures to students, I said, Hes trying to keep the community together and get us all past the blue period. 	Toms good, Jeremiah replied, Toms a good guy. 	Bob, I said, turning to the man who once flew between the towers of our city, administering justice to the ultra criminals. There were many who chose to use their power to steal and kill, why was it you chose to become a hero? 	Bob was quiet for a moment, and then said, I dont know. I guess I just didnt like seeing people get away with doing whatever they want. 	Have you seen any of the other people you put away? I asked, avoiding the mention of all the other things hed done to them first. 	No, he replied, I dont see the point. 	It might be therapeutic. 	Im not the one who broke the law. 	Bob would not speak further, so I turned to Jeremiah and said, Hows your day to day life been going? Have you been able to resume your previous life in any capacity? 	The people dont know what I did, but they recognize that I was one of the guilty. I havent been able to visit any of my old haunts Jeremiah replied. He looked pained for a moment and said quietly, I dont want to go home. My wife forgives me, but I cant stand the look in Jeremys eyes. I used to play with him every day when he was a kid, now hes like a stranger in my house who wishes I was dead. 	Bob, I said, reluctant to talk further with the man, How has your own family been treating you? 	I havent spoken to my family. Not in a long time, long before the blue. 	Your wife? 	Not married, no kids. 	Have your parents tried phoning you? 	Dont know. I dont answer the phone. 	Have you 	Bob stood up, interrupting me and said, This is a waste of time. I didnt break the law, Im a hero. You can look at his face for proof, and then left, closing the door quietly behind him. 	Jeremiah put his hand to his eyes and said, This was a mistake, I didnt want to see him. 	Its not going to be that easy; the heroes faces are being shown in all the movies. Their faces are plastered everywhere. You need to learn to live with a new normal. 	All I did was rob a few stores, but he beat me nearly to death. He cut meand Emily, the black queen. 	Jeremiah 	All she did was control men to give her money. She could have done worse things with her power to them, made them do things they wouldnt want to, but she only used her power to steal. She didnt deserve what he did to her. 	You spoke with her? 	I spoke with all the people he hurt. There were some bad people between them, but there were a lot of people on hard times who just wanted to help their families along. Some just wanted to have fun and never hurt anyone. 	What did Todd have to say about these meetings? 	Jeremiah raised a finger and said, Now this is just between you and me. You cant tell him anything or Ill be in trouble, this is confidential and you have to respect doctor patient confidentiality. 	Its okay Jeremiah, I never intended to. But you need to understand, you were all in the wrong. The reason why Salls going to get away with this is because hes the good guy, you were all breaking the law. 	So was he, vigilantism is illegal. 	The blue was a bad time. Too many people died, and a lot more hurt really badly. You have to understand people will look the other way when theyre angry. 	Jeremiah was adamant, and said, The law cannot be allowed to follow peoples whims. What he did to us is far worse than anything we ever did. Some people like Tom Peterson conducted themselves with high standards, so much so he may as well have been a member of the police, but folks like Sall just did whatever they wanted and ended up doing worse than the criminals they dealt with. I did wrong, I know that, but wheres my justice? I deserved to be thrown in prison, but I didnt deserve what Sall did to me, neither did Emily. If our rights are forfeit for literally any crime and heroes are allowed to do with us as they please, then what justice exists in our home, and what heroism do heroes truly possess?

","content":"  https://www.youtube.com/user/whereisjohntitor  I dont know how many of you have seen this series, but I feel its a ploy by the hoaxers (the Habers, IMO) to misdirect audiences and obfuscate the truth. I know its been 7 years since it came out, but I havent seen anybody bring this up before.  After watching the first couple episodes, you can tell the videos are produced. I searched up the company associated with the channel, EyesViewMedia, and found that their office was just a few blocks away from one of the listed addresses for Larry Habers office (there are three of them, IIRC). Found that kind of suspicious.   So, I went ahead and visited the areas they did in the videos too. I found that they seemed to have lied about the addresses they visited (the listed addresses sent me one place, but they visit different locations in the videos). It took me a while to find the buildings they actually shot at, and they had nothing to do with the addresses I found online.   The videos also seem to constantly try to vindicate the Habers of any hoaxing. Larry completely avoids mentioning Morey in the 'tell-all interview' episode. Everyone involved is giggling and having a good time.  The series also attempts to build some hype for a John Titor movie towards the end, they even show a little teaser, remember that Larry Haber owns the rights to the Titor story, people come to him asking for permission whenever they want to start a JT project.   Considering all this, EyeViewMedia's office's proximity to Haber's, the apparent misdirection with the addresses and building visited in the videos, the series' constant protection of the Habers, and the attempt at viral marketing for a JT movie, it makes me feel theres a chance Larry hired this media company to make the series. Maybe he knew those guys from someplace else, or maybe he chose a tiny startup to make it more believable.  Guess thats it, would like to know what someone else whose watched it thinks.  [Addendum: I wanted to keep this brief. Im currently going over the series, second by second, and compiling my notes. I might post that later, which would include my personal observations from when I visited the area, amongst other things. Im aware this is considered a 'fringe theory', Mike Sauve's words, but I cant watch a minute of this series without feeling horribly suspicious.] "},{"id":509076,"number":0,"nick": "subject2503","redditor":507955,"title":" I'm Bethan McKernan, Middle East reporter for The Independent.

An accomplished fiddle player, Hedley felt inexplicably drawn toward the instrument as a child. He got his hands on his own fiddle at age 8, and by 12, he was playing with middle-aged pickers at the VFW. At 19, he moved from his native Florida to Nashville, where he became an in-demand sideman at Roberts Western World and other bars, and ultimately, a well-respected frontman. Armed with an easy croon and prodigious fiddle playing, he became known as the Mayor of Lower Broad. He hit the road to perform with artists including Jonny Fritz, Justin Townes Earle, and more, while the 2015 documentary Heartworn Highways Revisited featured Hedley prominently.  Hedley didnt start writing his own songs until he was about 28 years-old. So on the backend of his 20s, he finally started writing, eventually unlocking a flood of clarity and creativity. The heartbreaking, distilled, defiantly classic country that poured out of him became Mr. Jukebox, a salve and beacon for 60s honky-tonk devotees everywhere.   - http://joshuahedley.com  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYn6-Hu4mBM  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYn6-Hu4mBM  - https://www.npr.org/2018/04/12/601103655/first-listen-joshua-hedley-mr-jukebox  Proof:   https://twitter.com/subject5029/status/985638144526700547 "},{"id":553715,"number":0,"nick": "subject3598","redditor":537680,"title":" Trying to paint in digital my traditional drawings.

All juice, no seeds is the goal.  My doc gave me the containers and instructions, which I, of course, didn't bother reading, as who really needs instructions for fapping? I did know that it had to be  neat  - no lube, no condom. No problem.   So I had a little self-lovin' time, filled the cup, and sealed everything up. Put it in a zip-lock baggie, then inside another bag for discretion, and headed over to the lab to drop it off.  I'd been told that all I need to do is let the receptionist know I have a  time-sensitive  specimen and they'd take care of everything. Apparently nobody told the receptionist this, as she started to ream me out for not booking an appointment. The lab tech is only available in the morning, which is why the sample was  time sensitive  - I'd assumed it was because they wanted the swimmers to be delivered asap.   Since the lab tech wasn't there, I was sent away with my sample, blushing the whole time as the reception area was full.  That was in February.

My mom said that I should eat much more if I did that effort but I was scared to eat a lot because I could feel sick in the pool . Now my questions are:  1. How often should I practice and for how long every day? 2. How many calories do you think my meal plan should include so I can gain weight? 3. I usually wake up at 7 a.m and I go to the pool after school (3 p.m). What should I eat before going? At what time?  Thank you a lot for patience!

Very handy. Was using also Hootsuite but did not like it.  Regarding FB - I read many articles that FB changed it algorithms and organic reach has been decreased to smth like 1% or 3% , don't really remember. Main idea behind it to make marketers use paid ads more often.  "}]
